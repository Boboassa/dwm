# Boboassa's build of dwm

dwm - the dynamic window manager, is an extremely small and fast
window manager for X.

## Requirements

In order to build dwm you need the `Xlib` header files and the color header
files generated by my colorscheme script (can be found at
[bin](https://github.com/Boboassa/bin)).

## Installation

Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the `/usr/local` namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

```
make clean install
```

## Running `dwm`

Add the following line to your `.xinitrc` to start dwm using `startx`:

```
exec dwm
```

## Configuration

The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom `config.h`
and (re)compiling the source code.

## Applied patches

Patches are a way of adding functionality to the minimal standard build of dwm,
in this build the applied patches are:

- Barpadding
- Center
- Centeredwindowname
- Colorbar
- Cycleleyouts
- Statuspadding
- Vanitygaps
- Zoomswap
